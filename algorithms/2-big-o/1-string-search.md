# Prompt

You are attempting to find the index of the first appearance of one string (the needle) inside of another (the haystack).

# Examples

``` javascript
indexOf('or', 'hello world'); // should return 7
indexOf('howdy', 'hello world'); // should return -1
indexOf('oox', 'ooboxoooxo'); // should return 6
```

## Common approaches:

***Built-in methods***

Most students' first instincts will be to use built-in string methods like ```indexOf()```, ```include()``` or ```substring()```. ```indexOf()``` is, of course, explicitly forbidden; steer them away from methods like ```include()``` and ```substring()```.

The reason to avoid this is that many whiteboard interviews will be language-agnostic and focus on the underlying concepts. You will want to show that you understand how these work, not that you read a lot of documentation the night before.

Another reason is that by using these methods, you may actually be adding more (hidden) complexity. Look into how ```indexOf()```, ```include()``` and ```substring()``` work under the hood. Many built-in methods actually add an operation that's O(n), or worse.

***split() and loop***

Most students also move to split the haystack into an array of characters and then loop through.

This approach would work; but imagine what it would look like to generate and then hold the array in memory for a very, very large haystack. If they're in a groove, have them finish out this approach and pseudocode it; then ask them how they would do this without generating a local copy.

That should lead you to the given solution, which uses pointers (kind of).

# Solution(s)

```javascript
function indexOf (needle, haystack) {
  for (let hIdx = 0; hIdx <= haystack.length - needle.length; hIdx++) {
    for (let nIdx = 0; nIdx < needle.length; nIdx++) {
      if (haystack[hIdx + nIdx] !== needle[nIdx]) break;
      if (nIdx + 1 === needle.length) return hIdx;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

*Note: where n is the haystack size and m the needle size, the solution above is O(n&#42;m). There are [other algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm#Single_pattern_algorithms), such as [Boyer-Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm) (well, [modified slightly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm#The_Galil_Rule)), that can perform at O(n+m) timeâ€”or even faster.*
